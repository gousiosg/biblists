        Continuous Integration (CI) has become a best practice of modern software development. At present, we have a shortfall of insight into the testing practices that are common in CI-based software development. In particular, we seek quantifiable evidence on how central testing really is in CI, how strongly the project language influences testing, whether different integration environments are valuable and if testing on the CI can serve as a surrogate to local testing in the IDE. In an analysis of 2,640,825 Java and Ruby builds on Travis CI, we find that testing is the single most important reason why builds fail. Moreover, the programming language has a strong influence on both the number of executed tests, their test run time and proneness to fail. The use of multiple integration environments leads to 10% more failures being caught at build time. However, testing in the CI does not seem to be a good surrogate for running tests in the IDE. To facilitate further research on Travis CI with GitHub, we introduce TravisTorrent.

@techreport{Gousi07,
	Abstract = {The purpose of the jvm is to abstract the Java language from the hardware and software platforms it runs on. Currently, there is an obvious duplication of effort in service provision and resource management between the JVM and the operating system that has a measurable cost on the performance of Java programs. The emergence of efficient hardware resource virtualisation mechanisms presents implementers with new opportunities for optimising the Java software execution stack.

In this paper, we examine the sources of the runtime overhead imposed on the Java programming language by the native execution environment. We use both synthetic and real world applications as benchmarks along with modern instrumentation tools to measure this overhead. We base our measurements on the assumption that the jvm can be directly hosted on virtualised hardware. Based on our findings, we also propose a cost estimation heuristic, which allows us to estimate the minimal gain to be expected when applications will be moved to hypervisor-hosted virtual machines.},

	Abstract = {A new trend in programming languages and system design is the use of constructs derived from the functional language field. Startups requiring fast product turnover and large corporations looking for increased maintainability are exploring the use of new, purely functional (such as Erlang or Haskell) or functionally-enabled (such as Scala and Ruby) languages, on the basis of decreased complexity and higher productivity. Despite the apparent increase in their use, the soft- ware engineering properties, including the alleged advantages, of such languages are largely underexplored. In this paper, we discuss the issues that prohibit the use of classic complexity and productivity metrics and present the rationale behind a new set of metrics that targets this increasingly important set of languages.},
