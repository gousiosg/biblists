  Abstract = {
    In the pull-based development model, the integrator has the crucial role of
    managing and integrating contributions. This work focuses on the role of
    the integrator and investigates working habits and challenges alike. We set
    up an exploratory qualitative study involving a large-scale survey of 749
    integrators, to which we add quantitative data from the integrator's
    project.  Our results provide insights into the factors they consider in
    their decision making process to accept or reject a contribution. Our key
    findings are that integrators struggle to maintain the quality of their
    projects and have difficulties with prioritizing contributions that are to
    be merged.  Our insights have implications for practitioners who wish to
    use or improve their pull-based development process, as well as for
    researchers striving to understand the theoretical implications of the
    pull-based model in software development.},
