  abstract={Recently, the popularity of functional programming as a way of
  solving computational problems has increased significantly. While most
  computer science curricula do include a course on functional programming, in
  many cases it is disconnected from practical applications, which is
  precisely where functional programming shines. To fill in this gap, we
  designed a functional programming course that required students to
  learn by experience in real world applications. In this paper, we present
  the course's design and outline our experience from delivering it.}
