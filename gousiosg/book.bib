	  is mostly taking place online. At the time of writing these words, we are
	  also planning a physical conference to take place in Athens, Greece, as
	  originally proposed back in 2017. The event continues the long,
	  distinguished ESEC/FSE tradition of presenting the best and most
	  innovative research in our eld, and facilitating interactions between
	  scientists and engineers who are passionate about advancing the theory and
	  practice of software engineering.},
