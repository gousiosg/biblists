  Title = {Protecting Web Users from {J}avaScript Injection Attacks},
  Year = 2012,
  abstract={Cross-site scripting (XSS) is one of the most common security vulnerabilities. It affects either web users on the client-side or web applications and their operators on the server-side. Most XSS exploits involve one basic vector: JavaScript. Adversaries find new ways to inject malicious scripts in the user’s browser by using a variety of techniques, despite the various counter-measures that have been introduced. This paper proposes a novel scheme to detect JavaScript injection attacks through a security module in the browser’s JavaScript engine. To detect an attack, our scheme uses location-specific signatures to distinguish between injected and legitimate JavaScript code fragments. These signatures are unique identifiers that represent specific characteristics of a JavaScript code statement and its execution context. To verify our scheme we have developed a prototype and tested it successfully against an extensive array of attacks.}

  Title = {Six ways to understand monads: Experiences from the functional programming course at {TU D}elft},
  Year = 2013,
  Month = May,
  Note = {Submitted to the ICSE software engineering education track},
  abstract={In the last few years, the popularity of functional programming as a way of solving computational problems has increased significantly. While most computer science curricula do include a course on functional programming, in many cases it is disconnected from practical applications, which is precisely where functional programming shines. To fill in this gap, we designed a functional programming course that required students to learn by experience with real world applications. In this paper, we present the course’s design and outline our experience from delivering it.}
