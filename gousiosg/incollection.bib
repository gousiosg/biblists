  abstract ="The PRAXIS project has been designed to facilitate the interchange of data between government and business entities through direct enterprise application interconnection. The system architecture has been entirely based on emerging technologies, including web services and XML, allowing independent client systems to operate asynchronously with a central server orchestrating and controlling the workflow. An original business document exchange protocol has been developed from the ground up in order to address the specific needs of business to government transactions in the Greek business sector. This paper elaborates on the methodologies and tools used for the development of the project’s coordination point (the server) and its clients, and present the experiences gained during the system’s design, as well as results obtained from the preliminary integration and testing phases."

Such a quality mea- surement can be used by organizations intending to deploy an Open Source solution to pick one of the available projects for use. We offer a case description of how the Software Quality Observatory will be applied to the KDE project to document and evaluate its quality practices for outsiders."
