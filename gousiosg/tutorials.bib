    At the beginning of every research effort, researchers in empirical software
    engineering have to go through the processes of extracting data from raw
    data sources and transforming them to what their tools expect as inputs.
    This step is time consuming and error prone, while the produced artifacts
    (code, intermediate datasets) are usually not of scientific value.  In the
    recent years, Apache Spark has emerged as a solid foundation for data
    science and has taken the big data analytics domain by storm. We believe
    that the primitives exposed by Apache Spark can help software engineering
    researchers create and share reproducible, high-performance data analysis
    pipelines.

    In our technical briefing, we discuss how researchers can profit from Apache
    Spark, through a hands-on case study.

    Git repositories are an important source of empirical so ware engineering
    product and process data. Running the Git command-line tool and processing
    its output with other Unix tools allows the incremental construction of
    sophisticated data processing pipelines. Git data analytics on the
    command-line can be systematically presented through a pattern that involves
    fetching, selection, processing, summarization, and reporting. For each part
    of the processing pipeline, we examine the tools and techniques that can be
    most effectively used to perform the task at hand. The presented techniques
    can be easily applied,  first to get a feeling of version control repository
    data at hand and then also for extracting empirical results.

  GitHub is the largest collaborative source code hosting site built on top of
    the Git version control system. The availability of a comprehensive API has
    made GitHub a target for many software engineering and online collaboration
    research efforts. In our work, we have discovered that a) obtaining data
    from GitHub is not trivial, b) the data may not be suitable for all types of
    research, and c) improper use can lead to biased results. In this tutorial,
  we analyze how data from GitHub can be used for large-scale, quantitative
    research, while avoiding common pitfalls. We use the GHTorrent dataset, a
    queryable offline mirror of the GitHub API data, to draw examples from and
    present pitfall avoidance strategies.
