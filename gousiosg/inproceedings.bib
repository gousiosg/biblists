  abstract = {A common requirement of many empirical software engineering studies is the acquisition and curation of data from software repositories. During the last few years, GitHub has emerged as a popular project hosting, mirroring and collaboration platform. GitHub provides an extensive REST API, which enables researchers to retrieve both the commits to the projects’ repositories and events generated through user actions on project resources. GHTorrent aims to create a scalable off line mirror of GitHub’s event streams and persistent data, and offer it to the research community as a service. In this paper, we present the project’s design and initial implementation and demonstrate how the provided datasets can be queried and processed.}

	Year = 2009,
  abstract = {Our work is concerned with an enriched perspective of what constitutes developer contribution in software infrastructures supporting incremental development and distributed software projects. We use the term “contribution” to express the combination of all the actions a developer has performed during the development process and propose a model for calculating this individually for developers participating in a software project. Our approach departs from the traditional practice of only measuring the contribution to the final outcome (the code) and puts emphasis additionally on other activities that do not directly affect the product itself but are essential to the development process. We use the Open Source Software (OSS) context to take advantage of the public availability of data in software repositories. In this paper, we present our method of calculation and its system implementation and we apply our measurements on various projects from the GNOME ecosystem.},

In this paper, we present the Alitheia Core platform in detail and demonstrate its usefulness in mining software repositories by guiding the reader through the steps required to execute a simple experiment.},

The quality evaluation process is usually based on hierarchical quality models that measure various aspects of software quality and deduce a characterization of the product quality being evaluated. The particular nature of open source software has rendered existing models unsuitable for detailed quality evaluations. In this paper, we present a hierarchical quality model that evaluates source code and community processes, based on automatic calculation of metric values and correlation of those to a set of predefined quality profiles.},

We propose a model that, by combining traditional contribution metrics with data mined from software repositories, can deliver accurate developer contribution measurements. The model creates clusters of similar projects to extract weights that are then applied to the actions a developer performed on project assets to extract a combined measurement of the developer’s contribution. We are currently implementing the model in the context of a software quality monitoring system while we are also validating its components by means of questionnaires.},

	Year = {2007},
  abstract = {The open source software ecosystem comprises more than a hundred thousand applications of varying quality. Individuals and organizations wishing to use open source software packages have scarce objective data to evaluate their quality. However, open source development projects by definition allow anybody to read, and therefore evaluate their source code. In addition, most projects also publish process-related artefacts, such as bug databases, mailing lists, and configuration management system logs. The software quality observatory is a platform that uses these product and process data sources to automatically evaluate the quality of open source projects. A plugin-based service-oriented architecture allows the mixing and matching of metrics extraction suites, source code repositories, and transformation filters. The resulting platform is aimed at IT consultants and managers, the open source community, and researchers.},

	Url = {/pub/paper.pdf},
  abstract = {Java is a strong player in the application server market and thus the performance of its virtual machine is an important aspect of a server's performance. One of the components that affect the performance of a {\sc jvm} is the memory manager, which also includes the garbage collector. Modern virtual machines offer a multitude of options for tuning the memory manager, which can have a significant impact on server application performance. 

In this paper, we examine the effect of tuning the garbage collection in an application server environment. By employing both synthetic and real world application benchmarks, we assess the various garbage collection strategies offered by two popular virtual machines. Finally, we present a comprehensive list of generally applicable garbage collection guidelines.}
