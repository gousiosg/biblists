  abstract = {In an age where all sectors of economic production strive to employ data-driven decision making, software production is still considered an art whose development processes cannot (and, according to many, should not) be evaluated. I believe that there is a lot to be learned by studying the software development process at a macroscopic level. If we treat development processes as big data sources, then we can come up with a diverse set of outcomes such as process support tools, guidelines for more efficient development, comparisons of programming techniques and even ecosystem-wide analyses. In my talk, I present my vision on how software analytic approaches can be applied to software development processes and elaborate them with examples from my current research. }
