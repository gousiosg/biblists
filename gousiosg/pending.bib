  abstract = {Pull requests form a new method for collaborating on distributed software
    development. To study the pull request distributed development model, we
      constructed a dataset of almost 800 projects, including some of the largest
      users of pull requests on Github. In this paper, we describe how the project
      selection was done, we analyze the selected features and present a machine
      learning tool set for the R statistics environment.}
