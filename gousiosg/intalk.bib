  Title = {Big Data Software Analytics},
  Year = {2015},
  abstract = {In an age where all sectors of economic production strive to
  employ data-driven decision making, software production is still considered an
  art whose development processes cannot (and, according to many, should not) be
  evaluated. I believe that there is a lot to be learned by studying the
  software development process at a macroscopic level. If we treat development
  processes as big data sources, then we can come up with a diverse set of
  outcomes such as process support tools, guidelines for more efficient
  development, comparisons of programming techniques and even ecosystem-wide
  analyses.

  In my talk, I present my vision on how software analytic approaches can be
  applied to software development processes and elaborate them with examples
  from my current research.
