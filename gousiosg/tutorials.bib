  GitHub is the largest collaborative source code hosting site built on top of
    the Git version control system. The availability of a comprehensive API has
    made GitHub a target for many software engineering and online collaboration
    research efforts. In our work, we have discovered that a) obtaining data
    from GitHub is not trivial, b) the data may not be suitable for all types of
    research, and c) improper use can lead to biased results. In this tutorial,
  we analyze how data from GitHub can be used for large-scale, quantitative
    research, while avoiding common pitfalls. We use the GHTorrent dataset, a
    queryable offline mirror of the GitHub API data, to draw examples from and
    present pitfall avoidance strategies.
