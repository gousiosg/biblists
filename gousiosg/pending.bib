  Abstract = {
    The pull-based development model, which is gaining widespread popularity with open source systems, offers a novel way to contribute to projects. In this paper, we analyze how contributors experience this model investigating the motivations that drive contributors, their work practices behind the scenes, and the challenges they face. We set up an exploratory qualitative study involving a large-scale survey of more than 650 contributors and analyze it in the light of previous research on contributors’ practices and the integrator’s role in the pull-based model. Our key findings indicate that motivations are similar to those in other models, but the better traceability for contributions make it more appealing to create a code portfolio. In addition, contributors have a controversial relation with awareness, and contribution challenges are mostly social in nature and are exacerbated by the high-volume, sparse, and asynchronous nature of the pull-based model. Communication within pull requests is limited to low level concerns. On these insights we provide recommendations to practitioners and discuss implications.

  Abstract = {
    The research community in Software Engineering and Software Testing in
particular builds many of its contributions on a set of mutually shared
expectations. These expectations often form the motivation for research on the
creation of new testing tools and the refinement of existing test processes in
an attempt to support practitioners. Despite the fact that they are the basis
for many publications as well as open-source and commercial testing
applications, the common expectations and beliefs are rarely ever questioned.
For example, Frederic Brooks' statement that testing takes half of the
development time seems to have manifested itself within the community since he
first made it in the ``Mythical Man Month'' in 1975. With this paper, we report
on the surprising results of a large-scale field study with 416 software
engineers whose development activity we closely monitored over the course of
five months, resulting in over 13 years of recorded work time. Our findings
question several commonly shared assumptions and beliefs about testing and might
be contributing factors to the observed bug proneness of software in practice:
the majority of developers in our study does not test; developers rarely run
their tests in the IDE; Test-driven Development is not widely practiced; and,
last but not least, software developers only spend a quarter of their work time
engineering tests, whereas they think they test half of their time.
